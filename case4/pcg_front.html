            <h2>Local Woman Wins Marathon</h2>
            <p>
              Estes Park native Laura Blake won the 27th Front Range Marathon over an elite field of the best
             long-distance runners in the country. Laura's time of 2 hr. 28 min. 21 sec. was only 2 minutes
              off the women's course record set last year by Sarah Rawlings. Kathy Lasker and Lisa Peterson
             finished second and third, respectively. Laura's victory came on the heels of her performance
              at the NCAA Track and Field Championships, in which she placed second running for Colorado State.
            </p>
            <p>
              In an exciting race, Peter Teagan of San Antonio, Texas, used a finishing kick to win the men's
             marathon for the second straight year, in a time of 2 hr. 12 min. 34 sec. Ahead for much of the
              race, Kyle Wills of Billings, Montana, finished second when he could not match Teagan's finishing
             pace. Jason Wu of Boulder, Colorado, placed third in a very competitive field.
            </p>
            <p id="lastP">
              This year's race through downtown Boulder boasted the largest field in the<br> marathon's history,
              with over 9500 men and 6700 women competing. Race<br> conditions were perfect with low humidity
              and temperatures that never<br> exceeded 85 degrees.

            <h3>Cougar Sightings Increase</h3>
            <p>
              Cougar sightings have increased 40% in the Este Park area according to a report released
              yesterday by the state DNR. In the last month alone, there were ten sightings in Estes Park
              and the surrounding communities of Grand Lake and Pinewood Springs. This compares to only
              twelve sightings2 for the entire spring of last year.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reasons for the growing number of cougar sightings include increasing encroachment by people into
              former wildlife habitats and new wildlife regulations that result in decreasing numbers of elk and
              deer being taken by hunters. Cougars may be wandering into developed areas, following the herds.
            </p>
            <p>
              DNR spokesman Steve Tasker asks residents to call the DNR report line at 555-6981 if they
              believe they have seen a cougar or any large predatory animal. Two fatalities have already
              occurred in the west this year from cougar attacks.

            <ol id="cougarList">
              <li>Stop, stand tall, and don't run. A cougar's instinct is to chase.</li>
              <li>Try to appear larger than the cougar by raising your arms.</li>
              <li>Back away slowly, always keeping eye contact.</li>
              <li>If the cougar displays aggressive behavior, shout and wave your arms. Convince the cougar that you are not prey, but a potential danger.</li>
              <li>In case of an attack, stay on your feet and fight back aggressively.</li>

            <h3>Highway 7 Reopens</h3>
            <p>
              Highway 7 will reopen this Friday, June 3rd, after a final safety inspection.
              A late blizzard delayed road crews, marking this as one of the latest dates on record for the
              highway's reopening.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rising to an elevation of over 12,000 feet, Highway 7 is a main link between Estes Park and Grand
              Lake. The reopening of the road is one of the annual signs that summer is near and the tourist
              season will soon be upon us!
