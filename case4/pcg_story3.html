<h1> Cougar Sightings Increase</h1>
<p id="story3" > Cougar sightings have increased 40% in the Este Park area according to a report released yesterday by the state DNR.
In the last month alone, there were ten sightings in Estes Park and the surrounding communities of Grand Lake and Pinewood Springs. 
This compares to only twelve sightings for the entire spring of last year.
Reasons for the growing number of cougar sightings include increasing encroachment 
by people into former wildlife habitats and new wildlife regulations that result in decreasing numbers of elk and deer being taken by hunters. 
Cougars may be wandering into developed areas, following the herds.
DNR spokesman Steve Tasker asks residents to call the DNR report line at 555-6981 
if they believe they have seen a cougar or any large predatory animal.
Two fatalities have already occurred in the west this year from cougar attacks.</p>
