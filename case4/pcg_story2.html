<h1>Highway 7 Reopens</h1>
<p id="story2" > Highway 7 will reopen this Friday, June 3rd, after a final safety inspection.
A late blizzard delayed road crews, marking this as one of the latest dates on record for the highway's reopening.
Rising to an elevation of over 12,000 feet, Highway 7 is a main link between Estes Park and Grand Lake.
The reopening of the road is one of the annual signs that summer is near and the tourist season
will soon be upon us!</p>
